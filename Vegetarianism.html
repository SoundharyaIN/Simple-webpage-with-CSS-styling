	<h1>How I added myself to the vegetarian statistics?</h1>
	<p>Let me take to you 2002!When I was studying Grade-3,I got a new teacher for the subject of Tamil language.She was so kind and cool to all of our student community.We love  her a lot because she used say lot of stories in between daily lessons and Tamil grammar classes.I used to lesson her stories without blinkingly my eyes.But,one day as like others the turning point happend in my life too.While I was attending Saturday weekend Tamil grammar classes, she asked us one question "Who are all non-vergetarians?".I raised hands all together with my friends.When she saw the huge crowdy hands,she put up the question in front of us-"You all are eating dead bodies.Do you?".I was wondering, omg am I doing wrong?</br>The next day, I went along with my dad to buy the mutton.I stood inside the stop,wherein the nearby room was closed with some cloth material.Within couple of minutes, felt like something poured upon my legs as I was wearing short trousers.Yeah,it was the blood of the goat which sounded the previous minute.Basically,my grandma,mom and sister are vegetarians.So,that was the minute I took the decision to become a Vegetarian for rest of my life,when I was 8 years old.And, still following it and would do so in future too.This decision was take by me because I would not like killing any lives to live my life.</p>
